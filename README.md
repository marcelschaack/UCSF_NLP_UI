# MENG Capstone Project: UCSF NLP UI for Apache cTAKES

You can find the complete repository of our project [in my colleagues repository!](https://github.com/LayneWei/NLP-Project)

Welcome to the UI Github.
You can find our preliminary python code in jupyter notebooks in the "Notebooks" directory.
These notebooks give information on the Word2Vec model training and the confidence score model training.

I am currently working on making this project installable to make it easier to deal with.
Until then, you can simply clone the repository, unzip the best_cosine_model file in the flaskr/cosine_similarity_model directory, and then run the flask application in a python GUI (e.g. Pycharm or Microsoft Visual Studio).

You must also install all the necessary packages and dependencies manually currently.

Please note that the performance of the UI may be slightly slow currently, as we are using advanced NLP pipelines to calculate the "confidence scores".

Thanks for trying this out!
The UCSF NLP Team.
